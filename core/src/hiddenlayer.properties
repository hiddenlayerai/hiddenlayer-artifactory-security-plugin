# The URL of the HiddenLayer API

hiddenlayer.scan.repo_ids=hf,hf-local

# If a model download is attempted for a model which HiddenLayer has not scanned,
# should the download be allowed?
# Note: If this is set to deny for a remote repository, the download will be blocked
# which will also prevent HiddenLayer from scanning the model.
# Options: 'deny' or 'allow'
# Optional.
hiddenlayer.scan.decision_missing=allow

# If a model download is attempted for a model which HiddenLayer has not scanned,
# should we request hiddenlayer to scan it?
# Note: This can lead to excessive API calls if the model is not found.
# When used with a remote repository and the scan_decision_missing=deny option, this
# will result in a call to the HiddenLayer API for every model download.
# Options: 'true' or 'false'
# Optional.
hiddenlayer.scan.missing_decision_retry=false

# After a model has been scanned and the results recorded in artifactory,
# should the artifacts be deleted from the HiddenLayer API?
# Note: Artifacts can only be deleted against SaaS versions of the model scanner.
# Enterprise model scanner does not support deleting artifacts.
# Options: 'true' or 'false'
hiddenlayer.scan.delete_artifacts_after_scan=true
